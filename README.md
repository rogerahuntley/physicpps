# physicpps
my self-rolled c++ implementation of a physics &amp; collision library

This library is being developed in sync with [my pacman clone](https://github.com/rogerthat52/snackman) and as such, isn't ready for use yet. It's being developed to work in conjunction with [ecpps](https://github.com/rogerthat52/ecpps), my entity-component-system library.
